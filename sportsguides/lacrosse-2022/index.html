						  <p>Dear readers,&nbsp;</p>
						  <p>&nbsp;When John Desko retired last June after 22 seasons as Syracuse's men's lacrosse head coach, both SU programs — men's and women's — were in for a significant change.
							Syracuse chose to keep things in the family, hiring Gary Gait, one of the greatest lacrosse players ever and the leader of the Orange's women's program. Replacing Gait at the helm of the women's program is Kayla Treanor, a former All-American attack at Syracuse who spent the last four years as an assistant coach at Boston College. 
							Gait looks to bring the men's program back to national championship contention after a first-round loss to Georgetown last season. Treanor, on the other hand, hopes to get the women's program over the hump in her first year in charge after losing in last year's national title game.
							Treanor and SU bring back Emily Hawryschuk, a preseason first-team All-American who tore her ACL just one game into last season, along with Emma Tyrrell, who notched five points in Syracuse's win over Northwestern in the NCAA Tournament semifinals last year, among others. 
							On the men's side, three-time All-American Brendan Curry returns at midfield, joined by Owen Seebold, a senior attack looking to step up after Stephen Rehfuss' graduation and an early-season injury suffered by Owen Hiltz. 
							This season opens the next chapter of Syracuse lacrosse, one featuring two new head coaches with a wealth of returning, and new, talent at its disposal. The Daily Orange's 2022 Lacrosse Guide has everything you need to know as the page turns toward the future.</p>
						  <p>Thanks for reading,&nbsp;</p>
